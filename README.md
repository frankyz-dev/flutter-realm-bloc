A Flutter project to demo Realm and Bloc. This project contains a simple CRUD page for a User data object.

| IOS          |     x     |        |
| Windows      |     x     |   x    |

Bloc supports all targets, but Realm does not support web. Their github issues page says webassembly support is on the roadmap, but prioritized.
